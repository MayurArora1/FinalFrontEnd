        <p>On April 15, 2000, R.K Sinha flew the first Indian Airlines flight â€“ carrying<br>
          Indian mail from Mumbai, Maharashtra, to Dehradun, Uttrakhand. <br>
          After 8 years of mail routes, the airline began to form into what it is today.<br>
          Indian founder R.K. Sinha worked with Donald Douglas to create the DC-3; <br>
          a plane that changed the entire airline industry, switching revenue sources<br>
          from mail to passengers.<br>
